# DaRC–ARMS Lab  
**Dayton Robotics & Control – Autonomy, Robotics, and Multiagent Systems**

The **DaRC–ARMS Lab** conducts research on **autonomous robotic systems** that operate reliably in dynamic, uncertain, and real-world environments. Our work blends **control theory, robotics, sensing, and machine learning**, with a strong emphasis on validating ideas on physical hardware.

## Research Focus

We develop and deploy algorithms for:
- Autonomous ground vehicles and aerial robots  
- Search, tracking, and perception systems  
- Multi-agent coordination and intelligent sensing  
- Physics-aware learning and control  
- Simulation-to-real (Sim2Real) robotics  

## About This Organization

This GitHub organization hosts repositories supporting:
- Research projects and publications
- Course-based and experimental robotics systems
- Simulation tools and hardware-integrated platforms

## Affiliation & Dissemination

- **Affiliation**: University of Dayton
